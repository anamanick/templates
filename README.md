<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
DistroKid now has mobile app for iOS. The purpose of the project is to be able to automate the mobile app iOS as well as Android using open source technology such as WebdriverIO and Appium. There is no alternative to the manual testing, but Automated testing certainly can saves time and effort in great deal. While automation can be run anytime, we can spot critical issue as early as possible by achiving automated testing.

Here's why:
* We can run automation while all CodeceptKids are busy listening cool music.
* Manual effort can be used for edge case, while Automation can run for sanity check
* Distrokids love Automation :smile:
